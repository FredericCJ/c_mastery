# Abstraction cost and enforcement review

Artifact/revision: ___. Compiler/flags/ABI: ___. Workload and contract: ___.
Comparison alternative with equivalent correctness/failure behavior: ___.
For each row state a bound, an observation or a justified non-applicability;
link the exact evidence and record any remaining gap.

For each guarantee name its enforcer: ISO rule, diagnostic/extension, external
verification, runtime check or caller discipline. Give a counterexample to a
stronger guarantee. Record measurement units, repetitions, uncertainty and
observer cost. A blank or unmeasured row is open evidence, not zero cost.

## Required family comparison

Compare unique and shared COW mutation, non-atomic and atomic ownership under identical thread/lifetime assumptions, whole-object versus split borrow tracking, and three-resource construction at every failure prefix. Count backing blocks and retained controls separately. Report atomic lowering, lock-free observation and callback allocation independently. Diagnostic poison work must not disappear from measured costs.

This is the learner evidence template, not a fabricated measurement report. Actual author observations remain in source-bound campaign logs.
