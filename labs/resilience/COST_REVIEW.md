# Abstraction cost and enforcement review

Artifact/revision: ___. Compiler/flags/ABI: ___. Workload and contract: ___.
Comparison alternative with equivalent correctness/failure behavior: ___.
For each row state a bound, an observation or a justified non-applicability;
link the exact evidence and record any remaining gap.

| Dimension | Mechanism/operation | Assumptions and bound | Observation and provenance | Failure policy / limit |

| Object representation | | | | |
| Reachable storage | | | | |
| Lifetime | | | | |
| Mutation and aliasing | | | | |
| Allocation | | | | |
| Movement and copying | | | | |
| Destruction | | | | |
| Dispatch | | | | |
| Concurrency | | | | |
| Failure | | | | |
| Compilation | | | | |
| Binary and stack | | | | |

For each guarantee name its enforcer: ISO rule, diagnostic/extension, external
verification, runtime check or caller discipline. Give a counterexample to a
stronger guarantee. Record measurement units, repetitions, uncertainty and
observer cost. A blank or unmeasured row is open evidence, not zero cost.

## Required family comparisons

Hold deadline, loss, ordering, effect-identity and cleanup guarantees equal before comparing policies. Count queued plus pending plus in-flight ownership; time to result and time to quiescence separately; retry/hedge amplification; concentrated expiry work; dedup retention; limiter burst; and durable outbox cost. Compare list/heap/wheel under the PR-T50-05 decision. No model tick is a measured nanosecond.
